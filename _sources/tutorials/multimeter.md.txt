==========

What's a Multimiter
-------------------

How to use it
-------------

> 1.  To measure volatage, connect PV1, PV2, PV3 to CH1, CH2, CH3 pins
>     on PSLab board respectively and turn knob to either of the channel
>     labels in the Multimeter instrument in PSLab Android application
>     to see the volatage at corresponding PV pins.
> 2.  To measure resistance, connect desired resistor between RES and
>     GND pin on PSLab board and then turn the knob to resistance symbol
>     in PSLab Android application Multimeter instrument.
> 3.  To measure capacitance, connect desired capacitor between CAP and
>     GND pin on PSLab board and then turn the knob to resistance symbol
>     in PSLab Android application Multimeter instrument.
> 4.  Frequency and count pulse can be measured by connecting any
>     desired element between ID (or LA) and GND pins on PSLab board and
>     turning knob to respective label in PSLab Android application
>     Multimeter instrument.
